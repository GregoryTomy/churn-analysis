# Churn Analysis

## Business Problem
Our task is to analyze customer behavior on Manningâ€™s liveBook website to understand the factors that influence customer retention and churn. The goal is to determine what encourages customers to return to the website regularly and identify the reasons why some customers stop visiting. By gaining insights into these patterns, we aim to develop strategies to enhance customer engagement and reduce churn, ultimately improving the overall customer experience and business performance.

### Project breakdown:
1. Clean and process customer behavior data for churn analysis.
2. Analyze customer metrics to uncover patterns and behavior that indicate customer churn.
3. Developed machine learning models to predict customer churn.
